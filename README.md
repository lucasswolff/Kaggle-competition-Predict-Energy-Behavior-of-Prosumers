# Kaggle-competition-Predict-Energy-Behavior-of-Prosumers
The goal of this Kaggle competition was to develop a forecast model to reduce prosumers (producer and consumer) energy imbalance costs.
To predict it, weather history and forecast, historial prosumer and geografical data were provided.

A stacked model was developed, leveraging both LightGBM and CatBoostRegressor. To optimize performance, hyperparameter tuning was conducted using cross-validation.
